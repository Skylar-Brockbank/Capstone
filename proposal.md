Name of Student: Skylar Brockbank

Name of Project: MappyBird

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) Allow users to make maps of oceans and islands for use in TTRPGs

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
My minimum viable product will allow the user to 
-Draw a grid style map
-Make modifications to their drawing
-Save a copy as an image file

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
I intend to use
-Html canvas
-javascript


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
Additional features will include:
-Proceedurally generated islands and oceans
-controls for modifying the way the elements are rendered

If I finish that, then I'll see about setting up live play options so that you can share this to users and play a live game using this tool.
-player view
-live interaction
-event triggers
-writable events
-procedurally generated events

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
-node.js
-Firebase

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

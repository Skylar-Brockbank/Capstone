__**Ideas**__
* Distribute resources across the map based on what elevation level the land is at and a noise map to generate the resource richness of an area
* Maybe add towns, cities and other civilization based items that generate in place?
* Use a 2 dimensional object list filled with encounter objects to place encounters that match the theme at the current map location and get their difficulty from the noise value of an encounter map
